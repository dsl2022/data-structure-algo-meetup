Average case
time O(log(N))
space O(log(N))(recursive), O(1) iterative

Worse case
time worst case O(N)
O(log(N)) (recursive) O(1) iterative

Time complexity (worst case):
Access: O(n)
Search: O(n)
Insertion: O(n)
Deletion: O(n)
Time complexity (average case):
Access: O(log(n))
Search: O(log(n))
Insertion: O(log(n))
Deletion: O(log(n))
